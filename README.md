# CSE 134B: Web Client Languages Project

Project Overview: The point of this project is to create a web application that deals with collaboration that has a start & finish, so we created a Travel Agency website using HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. The client is able to create an account, give travel information, and chat with a travel agent who helps the client pick flights, hotels, and activities they want to do at their destination. We created out own chat box where the client can talk to the travel agent at every step of the process. The website is also mobile compatible and scales with window size.
